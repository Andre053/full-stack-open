# FULL STACK OPEN

This repo is to track my progress through the Full Stack open course hosted at https://fullstackopen.com/en/.

Full Stack open introduces modern JavaScript-based web development, covering the following technologies: React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, and TypeScript; it focuses on building single page apps with React which use REST APIs built with Node.js.

The course is broken up into 13 parts, which will be subdirectories in this repo. 

Each subdirectory will have a notes.md file alongside files/directories related to exercises.
