# a - Node.js and Express
- NodeJS: JavaScript runtime based on Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript engine
- TRIVIA: Code running in the browser that is not yet supported must be *transpiled*
    - Popular transpiler is *babel*
    - JavaScript in the backend largely supports most new features
- Use `npm init` to set up a Node project
- *npm scripts* are defined in package.json under *scripts*
    - Customary to execute npm tasks with scripts
- Node's built-in web server module *http*
- TRIVIA: JavaScript in the browser uses ES6 modules, JavaScript in Node.js uses CommonJS modules
- `JSON.stringify()` to format strings for transport
- Using built-in http package is cumbersome, especially on large projects
    - Use a framework made to ease backend development instead
- See Node dependencies in the *node_modules* directory in the root of the project
    - Contains the source code
- TRIVIA: npm uses *semantic versioning*
    - Ex. ^4.18.2
        - Caret in front of the version number means that if and when the dependencies of a project are updated, the version of express that is installed will be at least the version number
        - The first number is the *major* number, if this number is the same, it is backwards compatible
        - Second number is the *minor* number
        - Third number is the *patch* number
    - Update dependencies with `npm update`
- Express
    - Most popular backend framework for Node.js
    - Event based
    - Handlers accept a request and response
- nodemon
    - Watches for file changes in the project and restarts node when detected
    - Still need to refresh the browser as there is no *hot reload* functionality
    - Must be called with the binary in *node_modules* if not calling from a script
        - Set a script to automatically call nodemon for the app, no path needed 
- REST
    - Representational State Transfer by Roy Fielding
    - Architectural style for building scalable web applications
    - Only care about the practical use as it relates to modern web design
    - *Resources* have an associated *URL* which is it's *unique address*
    - Uniform interface: A consistent way of defining interfaces that makes it possible for systems to cooperate
